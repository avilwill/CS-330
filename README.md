## Visual Graphics
#
I design UI diagrams using Figma to reference when implementing the front end of the code. I adhere to best coding practices when writing functions, verifying that the correct parameters are present and that the required data is returned.  I followed image references in this poject as well as usign the provided resource documents discussing the math and code of the assignment.

Since math is one of my strong subjects, I find it enjoyable to integrate animation, math, and coding. Before taking this class, I developed an interest in video game development. As I began to read the resources provided and learned about the projects I would be working on, I became excited about gaining knowledge in 3D visual graphics. I realized that even if I don't necessarily use OpenGL in my future game development endeavors, it's beneficial to understand the functions and requirements needed to create an object or scene. I know that development involves a combination of math, design, coding, and testing but I also have to consider factors like lighting, textures, and as I quickly learned, positions from all angles and perspectives.
